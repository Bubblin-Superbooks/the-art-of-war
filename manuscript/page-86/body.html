In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.</p><p>13. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.</p><p>14. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.</p><p>15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.</p><p>16.
