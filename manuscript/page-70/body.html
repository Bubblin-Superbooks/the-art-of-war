Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.</p><p>7. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.</p><p>8. Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fensâ€”all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.</p><p>9. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.</p><p>10.
