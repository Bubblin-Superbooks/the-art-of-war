He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.</p><p>37.

By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.</p><p>38.

He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.</p><p>39. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.</p></div> </div>
