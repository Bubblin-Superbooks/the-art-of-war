The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.</p><p>5. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments:</p><p>6. (1) When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.</p><p>7. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.</p><p>8. (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.</p><p>9. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">10.
