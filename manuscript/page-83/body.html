The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.</p><p>2. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.</p><p>3. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.</p><p>4. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.</p></div> </div>
