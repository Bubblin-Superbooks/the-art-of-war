It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.</p><p>5. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.</p><p>6. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.</p><p>7. In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.</p><p>8. If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt-marches.</p><p>9. In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.</p></div> </div>
