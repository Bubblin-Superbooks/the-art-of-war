All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.</p><p>28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.</p><p>29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.</p><p>30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.</p><p>31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.</p><p>32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.</p></div> </div>
